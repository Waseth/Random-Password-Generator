# Random Password Generator

This is a simple **JavaScript** app that generates strong, secure passwords using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

You can instantly copy your generated password to your clipboard with one click.

## Through building this project, I’ve learned,reminded myself or understood how to:

- Use **JavaScript strings and arrays** to store and manipulate character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
- Apply **Math.random()** and **Math.floor()** to generate random indexes for selecting characters.
- Use **while loops** and **string concatenation** to dynamically build passwords of a specified length.
- Understand how **DOM manipulation** works — updating the value of input fields directly through JavaScript.
- Implement **clipboard functionality** using `select()` and `document.execCommand("copy")` to allow easy password copying.
- Strengthen my overall understanding of **function logic, variable scope**, and how data flows in small JavaScript programs.

This project really helped me connect theory with practice and improve how I think through problem-solving in code.
